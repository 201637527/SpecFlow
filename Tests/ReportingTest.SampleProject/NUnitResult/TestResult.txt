***** ReportingTest.SampleProject.FeatureWithFailingScenariosFeature.IgnoredScenario
***** ReportingTest.SampleProject.FeatureWithFailingScenariosFeature.ScenarioWithFailingSteps
Given I have a precondition that is failing
-> error: simulated failure
***** ReportingTest.SampleProject.FeatureWithFailingScenariosFeature.ScenarioWithPendingSteps
Given I have a pending precondition
-> No matching step definition found for the step. Use the following code to create one:
    [Binding]
    public class StepDefinitions
    {
        [Given(@"I have a pending precondition")]
        public void GivenIHaveAPendingPrecondition()
        {
            ScenarioContext.Current.Pending();
        }
    }

***** ReportingTest.SampleProject.FeatureWithSuccessfulScenariosFeature.FirstSuccessfulScenario
Given I have a precondition that is successful
-> done: StepDefinitions.GivenIHaveAPreconditionThatIs("successful") (0,0s)
When I do something that works
-> done: StepDefinitions.GivenIHaveAPreconditionThatIs("works") (0,0s)
Then I have a postcondition that is successful
-> done: StepDefinitions.GivenIHaveAPreconditionThatIs("successful") (0,0s)
***** ReportingTest.SampleProject.FeatureWithSuccessfulScenariosFeature.SecondSuccessfulScenario
Given I have a precondition that is successful
-> done: StepDefinitions.GivenIHaveAPreconditionThatIs("successful") (0,0s)
And I have a precondition that is successful
-> done: StepDefinitions.GivenIHaveAPreconditionThatIs("successful") (0,0s)
When I do something that works
-> done: StepDefinitions.GivenIHaveAPreconditionThatIs("works") (0,0s)
Then I have a postcondition that is successful
-> done: StepDefinitions.GivenIHaveAPreconditionThatIs("successful") (0,0s)
